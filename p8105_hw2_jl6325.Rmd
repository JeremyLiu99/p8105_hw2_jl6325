Mr. Trash Wheel
```{r import_Mr}

                         sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",

Professor Trash Wheel
```{r import_Prof}

                         sheet = "Professor Trash Wheel",

Gwynnda
```{r import_Gwynnda}

                         sheet = "Gwynnda Trash Wheel",

Combining all 3 datasets
```{r combine}
Trash_Wheel_Datasets <- 
              bind_rows(Mr_Trash_Wheel, Professor_Trash_Wheel, Gwynnda_Trash_Wheel)
nrow(Trash_Wheel_Datasets)
ncol(Trash_Wheel_Datasets)
```
There are 845 observations and 15 variables in the resulting dataset(Trash_Whell_Datasets),
and the variables are name(which trash wheel), month, year, weight_tons, and homes_powered.
```{r Prof_tw}
filter(Trash_Wheel_Datasets, name == "Professor Trash Wheel")|>
  pull(weight_tons)|>
  sum()
```
The total weight of trash collected by Professor Trash Wheel is 216.26 tons.
```{r Cigaratte_butts}
filter(Trash_Wheel_Datasets, name == "Gwynnda", year == 2021, month == "July")|>
  pull(cigarette_butts)|>
  sum()
```
The total number of cigarette butts collected by Gwynnda in July of 2021 is 16300.
